at the first time. So I started running after you. With many messages, with many e-mails, with many QQ and many calls. Then we were dead gone in love. Since that I thought you were the one that I would treasure forever, the one I would love forever, the one I would follow forever and even the one I would die for.  The last four years we stayed together every moment, everywhere and every situation. The ship between you and me was being stronger and stronger. That time I thought nothing and no one can separate us and you are my world Iâ€™d never leave you.  Now darling, I want to be forever with you, live with you and accompany you to grow old. So darling marry me!
