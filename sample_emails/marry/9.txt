ur years ago I met you in a volunteer’s activity.  That time I found myself falling love with you at the first time. So I started running after you. With many messages, with many e-mails, with many QQ and many calls. Then we were dead gone in love. Since that I thought you were the one that I would treasure forever, the one I would love forever, the one I would follow forever and even the one I would die for.  The last four years we stayed together every moment, everywhere and every situation. The ship between you and me was being stronger and stronger. That time I thought nothing and no one can separate us and you are my world I’d never leave you.  Now darling, I want to be forever with you, live with you and accompany you to grow old. So darling marry me! Marry me! Make me the happiest person alive. Please, give me the honor of sharing my life with you. I love you and nothing means so much to me as being with YOU.
