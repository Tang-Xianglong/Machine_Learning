The ship between you and me was being stronger and stronger. That time I thought nothing and no one can separate us and you are my world Iâ€™d never leave you.  Now darling, I want to be forever 
Marry me. Make me the happiest person alive. Please, give me the honor of sharing my life with you. I love you and nothing means so much to me as being with YOU.
